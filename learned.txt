whats i learned in react

- create react app (npx create-react-app project-name)

- initial React

- ReactDOM.render();

- make simple components

- React.createElement();

- JSX

    - className

    - dynamic lists and values

    - key

    - condition in jsx

- event handler

- using image

-using style sheet

- useState

- how use state works

- pervious state

- conditional templates

- useState limitation : The Hooks Must Use The Top level of component - must use inside of component

- nested components

- props

- react fragments : 1- empty tag 2- React.fragments(); method

- children props

- functions as props

- portals

- ReactDOM.createPortal();

- Global Style sheet : all global things , should be here. and we should import it to index.js file.

- component style sheet : specific for own component. : if we wanna use global style in component style but we don't manipulate of the global style first we should select the parent element of the component and select all global elements and now i can manipulate that.

** Important : always select your target component in style sheet. maybe we wanna make another style with same class.


- css modules : again notice we should have class and id for targeting the elements
